## Description
The goal of this visualization is to reveal business activities of each politician. From the visualisation, one can see the relationships between political parties and companies that support them. Moreover, integrating with Thailand's government spending data allows us to see the connections between producement campaigns and those companies.

We hope this project will pave a foundation towards the country's political transparency and showing the importance of open data.
